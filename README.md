The Alfred directions skill enables the user to:
* Retrieve real-time commute time estimates
* Bookmark frequently visited locations

## Skill Architecture
The Alfred directions skill consists of two parts, a front end and a back end.
The front end is defined within the Voice User Interface (VUI), configured through the voice interaction model.
The back end is the programming logic of the application, developed with a serverless AWS Lambda approach.
